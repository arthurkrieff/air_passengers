# Airplane Passengers
The goal of this project is to predict the number of passengers for a given flight.
It was achieved during the "Python for Data Science" class, end of 2019.
Two challenges were faced during this project:
- Finding a good set of features 
- Finding a robut machine learning algorithm

## Motivation
Apart from the pure data science goal of this project, being able to correctly predict the number of passengers for a given flight would help flight companies to efficiently allocate aircrafts to routes.

## How to use ?
We have two main python files:
- **feature_extractor.py** contains a python class to prepare the features
- **regressor.py** contains a python class to apply the machine learning model

## Deliverables
We delivered the csv file with the predictions, as well as a PDF report explaining our approach.

## Credits
This project was made with the contribution of Aicha BOKBOT and Arthur KRIEFF.
