# Airplane Passengers
The goal of this project is to predict the number of passengers for a given flight.
This project was achieved with the contribution of Aicha BOKBOT and myself during the "Python for Data Science" class at the end of 2019.
Two challenges were faced during this project:
- Finding a good set of features 
- Finding a robut machine learning algorithm

# Motivation
Apart from the pure data science goal of this project, being able to correctly predict the number of passengers for a given flight would help flight companies to efficiently allocate aircrafts to routes.

# How to use ?
We have two main python files:
- **feature_extractor.py** contains a python class to prepare the features
- **regressor.py** contains a python class to apply the machine learning model

# Deliverables
We delivered the csv file with the predictions, as well as a PDF report explaining our approach.
